# Impact Brands Front-End Task

This task was done with React and Material UI

## Observations

App.js file could have been cleaner if FAQ list and Product list would have their own components 
and their logic inside of it.
Personally, as someone who worked mainly with Vue.js framework, based on the time spent on watching
udemy course on react to remember the framework structure before starting to code, I am happy with the result.
Not the best, of course, but not the worst either.

## Realization

I am starting to like React.
